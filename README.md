# Private Events Project Application

This is a project application for [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations?ref=lnav)
on Rails Associations. This project has a mock sign-on page, but no actual user authentication. It is simply a way to associate Events with a User_ID.

The main purpose of this project was to practice suing associations within the Ruby on Rails framework and associate Users and Events through a join table called Attendances.

More information ont he project can be found via the link above.
